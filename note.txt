We do not have to push one commit at the time

You can push multiple commits in one shot
There is no limit


If you have changes in changes tab you do not wish to commit you can right click and select discard changes, it will also remove it from the sublime


If you have commit that you did not push yet, you have option to undo the last commit by clicking on undo button right under Commit to master button
